  <h2>Abstract</h2>

It aims to highlight on-ground realities and offer actionable solutions to strengthen SHG impact in Ajmer, Rajasthan.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have emerged as grassroots movements aimed at promoting financial independence, social upliftment, and collective empowerment—particularly for rural women. In India, SHGs are often seen as catalysts for socio-economic development. However, their actual impact on the ground remains inconsistent and under-researched in certain regions.
  </p>
  <p>
    This research focuses on the city of Ajmer, Rajasthan, where the effectiveness of SHGs in improving women’s lives—through training, financial aid, and support networks—is still unclear. By combining literature review, field surveys, and data visualization, this study aims to provide deeper insight into the real outcomes of SHG initiatives in this region.

    <h2>Why We Did This Research?</h2>
    <p>
        Many rural and semi-urban women in India lack access to financial freedom, skill development, and social support.
        <br><br>
        Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have shown promise in empowering women economically and socially, but many studies miss ground-level realities.
        <br><br>
        Our research investigates the ground reality of Self-Help Groups in Ajmer — whether women truly receive growth opportunities, financial aid, and development support, or if these organizations exist only in name.
